# Interactive Phenotype Map

This is my second semester project in Bioinformatics Institute.
The main goal of this project is to make convenient app for doctors and geneticists, where they can view connection between input phenotypes.

### Main objectives were:

1. Make an app, which will visualize phenotypes
2. Find connections between risks and phenotypes from database


The main packages, which are used here are Shiny and VisNetwork.

You can find open this app in every browser, here is url - https://lonishin.shinyapps.io/interactive_phenotype_map/
